# Micromouse2015-16
Micromouse Project for the 2015-2016 year.


Hello! My name is Emilio Barreiro, I am a second year Computer Engineering major at UC Riverside. This is my second year participating in IEEE's Micromouse Project, but my first year taking on the challenge alone.

The objective of this project is to design, build, and program a small, autonomous wheeled robot that can solve a 16x16 cell maze by starting from an outer corner and navigating to the center. In order to complete its task, the robot will utilize IR emitters and sensors to detect walls and their promximity to the robot. This form of 'vision' will enable the robot to move through the maze while (hopefully) avoiding collisions :-).
